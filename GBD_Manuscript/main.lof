\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Diagram demonstrating the hybrid propagation physics model. The observatory optics are best described by a ray-based propagation model, so GBD is used to compute the field at the image plane before the coronagraph FPM. The field array is then handed to a Fresnel propagation model which propagates it past the FPM and through the remainder of the coronagraph.}}{6}{figure.2}%
