abstract = {This paper shows that a fundamental Gaussian beam propagating in a lenslike medium with cylindrical symmetry can be generated by the rotation about its axis of a skew ray which obeys the laws of geometrical optics. A complex representation: X(z) $=$ $\xi$(z) $+$ j$\eta$(z), where $\xi$(z) and $\eta$(z) are the projections of the skew ray on two perpendicular meridional planes, is discussed. It is found that the beam radius is equal to the modulus of X(z) and the on-axis phase to the phase of X(z). Using this representation, we derive a general expression for the on-axis phase shift $\Delta$$\Phi$ experienced by a beam with an input complex beam parameter q through an optical system whose ray matrix is \[ABCD\]:$\Delta$$\Phi$$=$phase of(A$+$B/q). When the beam is matched to the optical system (output q $=$ q), $\Delta$$\Phi$ can be written cos--1(A $+$ D)/2. This representation also provides a useful beam tracing method which is demonstrated and a simple interpretation for the known representation of Gaussian modes by ray packets.},

	abstract = {Scalar fields can be propagated through non-paraxial systems using the Gaussian beam decomposition method. However, for high NA objectives, this scalar treatment is not sufficient to correctly describe the electromagnetic fields inside the focal region due to high ray bendings, which result in a significant change in the polarization state of light. To model these vectorial effects, the Gaussian beam decomposition method has to be extended to include the polarization state of light. In this work we have combined it with the three dimensional polarization ray tracing in order to propagate vectorial fields through high NA optical systems. During the Gaussian beam decomposition, the polarization state of each individual beamlet is represented by a polarization vector [������������, ������������, ������������] associated with its central ray. Individual Gaussian beams are then propagated through the system using the complex ray tracing method. The effect of the optical system on the polarization state of each beam is computed by applying the three dimensional polarization ray tracing of the corresponding central rays. Finally the individual beams are superposed coherently in the plane of interest resulting in the complete vectorial field. We apply the proposed method to compute the vectorial field inside the focal region of a high NA microscope objective lens and compare our result to the vectorial Debye integral method. We find that the Gaussian beam decomposition method overcomes serious limitations of algorithms relying on Fourier transforms, i.e. the field sampling requirements are less critical in high NA focusing and in the presence of large aberrations. However, sharp edges in the amplitude profile are difficult to handle as they should be replaced with smooth Gaussian edge.},

	abstract = {The Optimal Optical Coronagraph (OOC) Workshop at the Lorentz Center in September 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands gathered a diverse group of 25 researchers working on exoplanet instrumentation to stimulate the emergence and sharing of new ideas. In this ﬁrst installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from oﬀ-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would beneﬁt our community to clearly deﬁne quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection signiﬁcance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise.},

	abstract = {HST provides an unparalleled venue for high contrast imaging which has enabled new observational domains in exoplanet and debris disk imaging. Unburdened by atmospheric "seeing", NICMOS and STIS achieve very low levels of background contamination from the wings of stellar point spread functions (PSF). Coronagraphy provides additional contrast gains approaching an order of magnitude at small angular distances from occulted stars. The stability of the platform allows scattered and diffracted light to be further reduced by two additional orders of magnitude through PSFsubtraction. The non-destructive read-out modes of the NICMOS detectors permit sampling the PSF, with its strong radial brightness gradient, over a dynamic range exceeding 5x107 in a single spacecraft orbit. In H-band, sub-stellar companions of ∆H ≈ 8 + 2 × (angular separation in arcseconds) are unambiguously detected in twenty minutes of integration (e.g., a 10 Myr "hot Jupiter" at 2.5 arcseconds from an occulted star). Raw sensitivity metrics, such as presumtively static Strehl ratios, are often invoked in comparing the performance of different instrumental systems but belie the true detectability levels which are dominated by systemic non-repeatable PSF variations (not photon statistics). Such variations can give rise to false detections of companions (and circumstellar disks) and introduce very significant photometric errors. The ability to rotate the HST field with high precision about the target axis and acquire temporally stable reference PSFs readily permits the identification and rejection of rotationally-invariant optical artifacts. We discuss the repeatable, quantifiable performance limits routinely reached by HST (currently unachievable on groundbased systems), for which PSF stability is critical.},

	abstract = {The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument is an extremely modular high-contrast instrument installed on the Subaru telescope in Hawaii. SCExAO has a dual purpose. Its position in the northern hemisphere on a 8-meter telescope makes it a prime instrument for the detection and characterization of exoplanets and stellar environments over a large portion of the sky. In addition, SCExAO's unique design makes it the ideal instrument to test innovative technologies and algorithms quickly in a laboratory setup and subsequently deploy them on-sky. SCExAO benefits from a first stage of wavefront correction with the facility adaptive optics AO188, and splits the 600-2400 nm spectrum towards a variety of modules, in visible and near infrared, optimized for a large range of science cases. The integral field spectrograph CHARIS, with its J, H or K-band high-resolution mode or its broadband low-resolution mode, makes SCExAO a prime instrument for exoplanet detection and characterization. Here we report on the recent developments and scientific results of the SCExAO instrument. Recent upgrades were performed on a number of modules, like the visible polarimetric module VAMPIRES, the high-performance infrared coronagraphs, various wavefront control algorithms, as well as the real-time controller of AO188. The newest addition is the 20k-pixel Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKIDS) Exoplanet Camera (MEC) that will allow for previously unexplored science and technology developments. MEC, coupled with novel photon-counting speckle control, brings SCExAO closer to the final design of future high-contrast instruments optimized for Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs).},

	abstract = {Coronagraph instruments on future space telescopes will enable the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars for the ﬁrst time. The quest for the optimal optical coronagraph designs has made rapid progress in recent years thanks to the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) initiative led by the Exoplanet Exploration Program at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a result, several types of high-performance designs have emerged that make use of dual deformable mirrors to (1) correct for optical aberrations and (2) suppress diﬀracted starlight from obstructions and discontinuities in the telescope pupil. However, the algorithms used to compute the optimal deformable mirror surface tend to be computationally intensive, prohibiting large scale design surveys. Here, we utilize the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO), a tool that allows for rapid optimization of deformable mirror shapes, to explore trade-oﬀs in coronagraph designs for obstructed and segmented space telescopes. We compare designs for representative shaped pupil Lyot and vortex coronagraphs, two of the most promising concepts for the LUVOIR space mission concept. We analyze the optical performance of each design, including their throughput and ability to passively suppress light from partially resolved stars in the presence of low-order aberrations. Our main result is that deformable mirror based apodization can suﬃciently suppress diﬀraction from support struts and inter-segment gaps whose widths are on the order of ∼0.1\% of the primary mirror diameter to detect Earth-sized planets within a few tens of milliarcseconds from the star.},

The functional form of these aberrations, called polarization aberrations, result from the angles of incidence and the variations of the coatings as a function of angle. These coatings induce small modifications to the PSF, which consists of four separate components, two nearly Airy-disk PSF components, and two faint components, we call ghost PSF components, with a spatial extent about twice the size of the diffraction limited image. As the specifications of optical systems constantly improve, these small effects become increasingly important. It is shown how the magnitude of these ghost PSF components, at {\textasciitilde}10-5 in the example telescope, can interfere with exoplanet detection with coronagraphs.},

These new coronagraphs provide a key advance to enabling direct imaging and spectroscopy of Earth twins with future large space missions. Building on shaped pupil (SP) apodization optimizations, our approach enables two-dimensional optimizations of the system to address any aperture features such as central obstruction, support structures, or segment gaps. We illustrate the technique with a design that could reach a 1010 contrast level at 34 mas for a 12 m segmented telescope over a 10\% bandpass centered at a wavelength of l0 = 500 nm. These designs can be optimized speciﬁcally for the presence of a resolved star and, in our example, for stellar angular size up to 1.1 mas. This would allow one to probe the vicinity of Sun-like stars located beyond 4.4 pc, therefore, fully retiring this concern. If the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is hÅ = 0.1, with 18\% throughput, assuming a perfect, stable wavefront and considering photon noise only, 12.5 exo-Earth candidates could be detected around nearby stars with this design and a 12 m space telescope during a ﬁve-year mission with two years dedicated to exo-Earth detection (one total year of exposure time and another year of overheads). Our new hybrid APLC/SP solutions represent the ﬁrst numerical solution of a coronagraph based on existing mask technologies and compatible with segmented apertures, and that can provide contrast compatible with detecting and studying Earth-like planets around nearby stars. They represent an important step forward toward enabling these science goals with future large space missions.},

	abstract = {Scalar fields can be propagated through non-paraxial systems using the Gaussian beam decomposition method. However, for high NA objectives, this scalar treatment is not sufficient to correctly describe the electromagnetic fields inside the focal region due to high ray bendings, which result in a significant change in the polarization state of light. To model these vectorial effects, the Gaussian beam decomposition method has to be extended to include the polarization state of light. In this work we have combined it with the three dimensional polarization ray tracing in order to propagate vectorial fields through high NA optical systems. During the Gaussian beam decomposition, the polarization state of each individual beamlet is represented by a polarization vector [������������, ������������, ������������] associated with its central ray. Individual Gaussian beams are then propagated through the system using the complex ray tracing method. The effect of the optical system on the polarization state of each beam is computed by applying the three dimensional polarization ray tracing of the corresponding central rays. Finally the individual beams are superposed coherently in the plane of interest resulting in the complete vectorial field. We apply the proposed method to compute the vectorial field inside the focal region of a high NA microscope objective lens and compare our result to the vectorial Debye integral method. We find that the Gaussian beam decomposition method overcomes serious limitations of algorithms relying on Fourier transforms, i.e. the field sampling requirements are less critical in high NA focusing and in the presence of large aberrations. However, sharp edges in the amplitude profile are difficult to handle as they should be replaced with smooth Gaussian edge.},

For instance, when a surface under test is not conjugate to the detector, the effects due to diffraction from the edge of the surface cannot be modeled with ray-based approaches. Modern lens design software generally includes tools for modeling beam propagation. These tools can be used to go beyond conventional ray-based modeling of interferometers. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of these beam propagation tools by modeling various aspects of a point-diffraction interferometer that go beyond solely ray-based approaches.},

	abstract = {An algorithm for arbitrary electromagnetic (EM) beam propagation is proposed and well demonstrated in this paper. The essential idea of this algorithm is to decompose arbitrary beam into a small number of elliptical Gaussian beams, which is similar but different from existing diffracted Gaussian beam analysis (DGBA) based on Gabor expansion. The proposed algorithm utilizing adaptive Gaussian beam matching method is much more efficient than regular decomposition strategy by Gabor expansion. Beam propagation is then calculated by these elliptical Gaussian beams' superposed analytical results, with accuracy comparable with physical optics (PO) theory. This fast algorithm can be suitable for analyzing beam propagation in electrically-large systems, such as reflector antennas and quasi-optical (QO) transforming systems.},

	abstract = {Methods of shaping laser beams within the laser resonator are studied. The simplest form of shaping is the spatial mode generation inherent in the laser cavity due to the geometry of the resonator in conjunction with gain to compensate for roundtrip losses, such as diffraction and output coupling. Typically the fundamental mode or multimode behavior is exhibited from such configurations. Passive mode shaping can be accomplished by introducing static amplitude or phase masks. An example of an amplitude mask is provided in order to generate a higher-order spatial mode. Active mode shaping can be accomplished by altering the optical pump distribution. This case is studied experimentally with a diode-end-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser and compared to modeling of expected Hermite-Gaussian mode generation. Active mode shaping allows the preferred mode distribution to be altered in real time. Additional shaping can be done following the resonator to modify a Hermite-Gaussian mode into a psuedo-Laguerre-Gaussian mode. This work also shows that using the coherent propagation method of Gaussian beam decomposition is capable of modeling and describing intracavity beam shaping.},

Standard methods for coronagraphic simulations involve Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) of very large arrays, and computing power is an issue for the design and tolerancing of coronagraphs on segmented Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT) in order to handle both the speed and memory requirements. Our method combines a semi-analytical approach with non-FFT based Fourier transform algorithms. It enables both fast and memory-efficient computations without introducing any additional approximations. Typical speed improvements based on computation costs are of about ten to fifty for propagations from pupil to Lyot plane, with thirty to sixty times less memory needed. Our method makes it possible to perform numerical coronagraphic studies even in the case of ELTs using a contemporary commercial laptop computer, or any standard commercial workstation computer.},

abstract = {Decomposition of a general arbitrary field into a set of Gaussian beams has been one of the challenges in the Gaussian beam decomposition method for field propagation through optical systems. The most commonly used method in this regard is the Gabor expansion, which decomposes initial fields into shifted and rotated Gaussian beams in a plane. Since the Gaussian beams used have zero initial curvatures, the Gabor expansion method does not utilize the ability of the Gaussian beams to represent the quadratic behavior of the local wavefront. In this paper, we describe an alternative method of decomposing an arbitrary field with smooth wavefront into a set of Gaussian beams with non-zero initial curvatures. The individual Gaussian beams are used to represent up to the quadratic term in the Taylor expansion of the local wavefront. This significantly reduces the number of Gaussian beams required for the decomposition of the field with smooth wavefront and gives more accurate decomposition results. The proposed method directly gives the five ray sets representing the parabasal Gaussian beams, which can then be directly used for propagation of the Gaussian beams through optical systems. To demonstrate the application of the method, we have presented results for the decomposition of fields with strongly curved spherical wavefronts, a cone shaped wavefront, and a wavefront with large spherical aberration. The numerical comparison of the input field with the field reconstructed after the decomposition shows very good agreement in both amplitude and phase profiles. We also show results for the far field intensity distributions of the decomposed wavefronts by propagating in free space using the Gaussian beam propagation method.},

An example of the first on reasonably–priced Intel/Microsoft platforms is used to test whether relevant single-core computational speeds have kept up with predictions, from the early 1990’s 32-bit 486s running extended DOS to today’s 64-bit CPUs running Windows 10. It is found that before around 2005, performance doubled every 18 months (equivalent to 100 times every decade) as predicted by House’s variant of Moore’s 1975 law. At that time thermal issues lead to a more efficient microarchitecture and a relative stagnation of CPU frequencies so progress slowed significantly, but could be mostly reclaimed by the effective utilization of a large number of computational cores. Therefore, previously published results comparing multi-core performance on the other tasks will be updated using nearly a decade newer CPUs and GPUs. Even though they have much higher clock rates and core counts than the old hardware, their relative performances fall short (and sometimes far short) of expectations.},
